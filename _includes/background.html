      I'm currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science at 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.upstatement.com/" target="_blank">The University of Georgia</a> studying and researching things in the field with awesome people. I worked as a Salesforce Developer Success Engineer at
      <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.ccis.northeastern.edu/" target="_blank">Salesforce</a> for three years.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a computer science grad student, I enjoy bridging the gap between study and engineering combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create products. I aspire and work towards building applications that are scalable
      and efficient.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably singing, playing table-tennis or cooking my favorite dishes.
